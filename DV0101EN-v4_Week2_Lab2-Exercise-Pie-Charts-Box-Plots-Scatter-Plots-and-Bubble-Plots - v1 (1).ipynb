The lab will explore the creation and understanding of Pie Charts, Box Plots, Scatter Plots, and Bubble Plots, providing insights into health data related to diabetes. Through hands-on exercises and real-world datasets, you'll gain the abilities to effectively represent and analyze medical information using Matplotlib's diverse plotting techniques. This lab will prepare you to make informed decisions and advancements in the field of healthcare, particularly in diabetes research and analysis.\n\nEstimated time needed: **30** minutes\n\n## Objectives\n\nAfter completing this lab you will be able to:\n\n*   Explore Matplotlib library further\n*   Create pie charts, box plots, scatter plots and bubble charts\n"

Let's use this dataset as an example to practice data reading.\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Data source: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes</a></li>\n    <li>Data type: csv</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe statistical data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes under [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.\n\nDataset output column is \"Readmitted\" with values \"<30\",\">30\",\"NO\". The rest of the columns (44) are input columns.\n\nThe Pandas Library is a useful tool that enables us to read various datasets into a dataframe; our Jupyter notebook platforms have a built-in <b>Pandas Library</b> so that all we need to do is import Pandas without installing.\n\nWe have already **pre-processed** the data, we will use the **clean data** saved in the csv format for this lab. The original Diabetes dataset can be fetched from [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX0IT0EN/diabetic_data.csv).\n</p>\n\n<details><summary>DataSet structure</summary>\nColumn names:\n    \n1. `Race` - Race.

        "# Scatter Plots <a id=\"10\"></a>\n\nA `scatter plot` (2D) is a useful method of comparing variables against each other. `Scatter` plots look similar to `line plots` in that they both map independent and dependent variables on a 2D graph. While the data points are connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a scatter plot. The data in a scatter plot is considered to express a trend. With further analysis using tools like regression, we can mathematically calculate this relationship and use it to predict trends outside the dataset.\n\nLet's start by exploring the following:\n\nUsing a `scatter plot`, let's visualize the trend of number of diagnoses among patients with diabetes for all age groups.\n"

        "## Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, the use of various visualization tools such as Pie Charts, Box Plots, Scatter Plots, and Bubble Plots can greatly aid healthcare professionals in understanding and communicating diabetes data effectively. Pie Charts can provide a clear overview of the share of people with diabetes, enabling quick comparisons and identifying trends. Box Plots, Scatter Plots, and Bubble Plots can offer deeper insights by showcasing distribution patterns, correlations, and potential outliers, supporting informed decision-making and targeted interventions to address health disparities across different regions.\n"
