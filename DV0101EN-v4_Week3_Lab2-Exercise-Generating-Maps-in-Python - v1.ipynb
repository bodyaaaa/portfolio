You'll harness the power of these technologies to create maps that uncover insights into healthcare trends, focusing specifically on diabetes data. Through interactive activities, you'll generate visual displays that unveil geographical intricacies related to diabetes prevalence.\n\nEstimated time needed: **30** minutes\n    \n\n## Objectives\n\nAfter completing this lab you will be able to:\n\n* Create maps and visualize geospatial data with Folium\n"

        "## Introduction\n\nIn this lab, we will learn how to create maps for different objectives. To do that, we will part ways with Matplotlib and work with another Python visualization library, namely **Folium**. What is nice about **Folium** is that it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data. While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as **plotly**, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. **Folium**, on the other hand, is completely free.\n"

        "# Exploring Datasets<a id=\"0\"></a>\n\nToolkits: This lab heavily relies on [*pandas*](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [*Numpy*](http://www.numpy.org/) for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The primary plotting library we will explore in this lab is [**Folium**](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium/).\n\n## The Dataset: Diabetes 130 US hospitals for years 1999-2008<a id=\"1\"></a>\n<p>\nThere are various formats for a dataset: .csv, .json, .xlsx  etc. The dataset can be stored in different places, on your local machine or sometimes online.<br>\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to load a dataset into our Jupyter Notebook.<br>\n\nIn our case, the Diabetes Dataset is an online source, and it is in a CSV (comma separated value) format. Let's use this dataset as an example to practice data reading.\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Data source: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes</a></li>\n    <li>Data type: csv</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe statistical data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes under [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.\n\nDataset output column is \"Readmitted\" with values \"<30\",\">30\",\"NO\". The rest of the columns (44) are input columns.\n\nThe Pandas Library is a useful tool that enables us to read various datasets into a dataframe; our Jupyter notebook platforms have a built-in <b>Pandas Library</b> so that all we need to do is import Pandas without installing.\n\nWe have already **pre-processed** the data, we will use the **clean data** saved in the csv format for this lab. The original Diabetes dataset can be fetched from [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-GPXX0IT0EN/diabetic_data.csv).\n</p>\n\n<details><summary>DataSet structure</summary>\nColumn names:\n    \n1. `Race` - Race.

        "**GeoPandas** is an open-source Python library that extends the capabilities of pandas, a popular data manipulation library, by adding geospatial operations and data types. It enables you to work with geospatial data within a DataFrame-like structure, combining the functionality of pandas with the ability to handle geometric objects.\n\nKey features of GeoPandas include:\n\n> Geometric operations: GeoPandas allows you to perform various geometric operations on geometric objects, such as points, lines, and polygons. This includes operations like intersection, union, buffer, distance calculation, and more.\n\n> Data structures: GeoPandas introduces two main data structures: GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame. These structures are similar to pandas Series and DataFrame but are specifically designed to handle geometric data. GeoSeries holds a collection of geometric objects, while GeoDataFrame is a tabular data structure that contains a GeoSeries along with other columns of data.\n\n> Integration with spatial data formats: It supports reading and writing data in various geospatial file formats, such as GeoJSON, ESRI Shapefiles, and more. This makes it easy to import and export geospatial data.\n\n> Visualization: GeoPandas provides visualization capabilities, allowing you to create maps and plots directly from GeoDataFrames. It integrates well with libraries like Matplotlib for plotting and visualizing geospatial data.\n\nGeoPandas simplifies geospatial data manipulation and analysis by leveraging the power of pandas and providing an interface for handling geographic data seamlessly within the Python ecosystem.\n"

To determine that, you will need to open the GeoJSON file using any text editor and note the name of the key or variable that contains the name of the states, since the states are our variable of interest. In this case, **NAME** is the key in the GeoJSON file that contains the name of the states. Note that this key is case_sensitive, so you need to pass exactly as it exists in the GeoJSON file.\n"

        "## Conclusions\n\nIn summary, leveraging tools such as Folium for geospatial data visualization presents significant potential in the healthcare sector, especially in visualizing diabetes in the USA. Through the conversion of intricate datasets into interactive maps, healthcare practitioners can glean crucial insights into geographic patterns and discrepancies in diabetes distribution. This equips them to make educated choices, efficiently distribute resources, and execute precise interventions aimed at enhancing diabetes wellness on a global scale.\n"
